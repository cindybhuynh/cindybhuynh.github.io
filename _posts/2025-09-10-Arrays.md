title: Arrays

Arrays are fundamental data structures that appear often. They are used to store multiple values inside a single variable. 

In most languages, arrays usually start with an index of 0. This means that the first element has an index of 0, which is the number inside the square brackets when accessing an element.

C and Python both support arrays that start at an index of 0. 

## Declaring Arrays
In C, arrays are declared by defining the data type (int, float, char, etc.), naming the array, followed by square brackets []. End with a semicolon ; to end the line without assigning any values.

## Initializing Arrays
In C, arrays are initialized by assigning values to them using curly braces {}.

## Fixed Arrays
In C, arrays are fixed, so the size of the array is dependent on the values that are first assigned to it. Once a value has been given, the size of the array cannot change. The size of the array can be chosen during declaration. 

Here's an example of setting the size of an array when declaring:

## Printing Element Example
This code shows how to print an element in an array:

## Dynamic Arrays
In Python, arrays are also known as lists. The lists function like dynamic arrays. Dynamic arrays don't have fixed sizes. Values can easily be added or removed without worrying about the size of the array.

## Notes
This post covers the basics of arrays, but there are many more functions that arrays are used for. Arrays can be utilized in many different ways outside of basic declaration and initialization.

## Time Complexity
Worst Case
* Access: O(1)
* Search: O(n)
* Insertion: O(n)
* Deletion: O(n)
