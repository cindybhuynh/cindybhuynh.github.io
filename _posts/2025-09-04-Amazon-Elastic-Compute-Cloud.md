---

The Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance is a virtual server provided by the AWS EC2 service. 

EC2 is an AWS service that provides secure copmuting power with resizeable servers or instances using a pay as you go system.

Businesses and applications require computing power to run. So, where does the computing power come from? 

## Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
EC2 is valuable because it is:
* Highly flexible
* Cost-effective
* Quick

With EC2, customers can easily utilize AWS data centers and servers. The customer just needs to request the EC2 instances as needed.

AWS instance types are configurations of virtual servers consisting of a combination of resources. 
There are different categories of instance types that vary depending on the specific combination of resources required.

For example, general purpose EC2 instances contain a solid balance of compute power, memory, and networking resources. They are best suited for applications such as web servers and code repositories.

What if a computing task is limited by the Central Processing Unit (CPU)?
Compute optimized EC2 instances have more compute power. They are ideal for CPU-bound applications that require high-performance processors.
