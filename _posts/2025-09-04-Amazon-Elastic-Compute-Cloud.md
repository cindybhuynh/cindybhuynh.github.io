title: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
---

The Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance is a virtual server provided by the AWS EC2 service. EC2 is an AWS service that provides secure copmuting power with resizeable servers or instances using a pay as you go system.

Businesses and applications require computing power to run. So, where does the computing power come from? 

## Benefits of EC2
EC2 is valuable because it is:
* Highly flexible
* Cost-effective
* Quick

With EC2, customers can easily utilize AWS data centers and servers. The customer just needs to request the EC2 instances as needed.

## EC2 Use Cases
Here's a diagram the shows the main use cases of Amazon EC2:

## AWS Instance Types
AWS instance types are configurations of virtual servers consisting of a combination of resources. 
There are different categories of instance types that vary depending on the specific combination of resources required.

For example, general purpose EC2 instances contain a solid balance of compute power, memory, and networking resources. 
They are best suited for applications such as web servers and code repositories.

What if a computing task is limited by the Central Processing Unit (CPU)?

Compute optimized EC2 instances have more compute power. They are ideal for CPU-bound applications that require high-performance processors. 

These are the other EC2 instance types: memory optimized, accelerated computing, storage optimized, and HPC optimized.
